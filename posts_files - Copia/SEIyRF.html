<br /><p>@FranciscoPresencia: I support your comments about avoiding using this for random passwords. However, I disagree that this answer should not be plus-one'd. I have plus-one'd this option for since it is an effective one-line solution for generating random strings (the original topic of this question)</p><p>8</p><p>@FranciscoPresencia the reason it is not secure is because it never uses the same character twice. That makes it a <i>terrible</i> password generator. Please everyone stop up voting this, it is totally insecure must never be used. As the password gets longer, the number of characters you must test in a brute force gets shorter because you do not bother testing any previously used character. –&nbsp;<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/19851/abhi-beckert">Abhi Beckert</a> <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4356289/php-random-string-generator#comment26591619_13212994">Aug 9 '13 at 19:33</a></p><p>20</p><p>Weak it may be, but it's quick and easy. Depending on the use-case, this is fine -- I've used it because I didn't need security or strength; just a quick-fire shuffle. I'm writing a unit test, and this gives me a suitably random input to test with. –&nbsp;<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/1069607/sdc">SDC</a> <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4356289/php-random-string-generator#comment21705715_13212994">Mar 12 '13 at 13:44</a></p><p>20</p><p>Do not do this, it is extremely weak.
